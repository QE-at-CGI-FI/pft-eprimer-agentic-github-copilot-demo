# Next Testing Priorities for EPrimer Application

Based on the known bugs and the Big List of Naughty Strings (BLNS) patterns, here are the **top 10 prioritized testing approaches** that could reveal new information about the EPrimer application:

## **Priority 1: Unicode and Character Encoding Issues**
**Test Variables:**
```python
unicode_tests = [
    "表ポあA鷗ŒéＢ逍Üßªąñ丂㐀𠀀",  # Special Unicode Characters Union
    "Ṱ̺̺̕o͞ ̷i̲̬͇̪͙n̝̗͕v̟̜̘̦͟o̶̙̰̠kè͚̮̺̪̹̱̤",  # Zalgo text
    "𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐟𝐨𝐱",  # Unicode font variations
    "‪‪test‪",  # Right-to-left override
]
```
*Rationale: Known issues with special characters suggest deeper Unicode handling problems.*

## **Priority 2: HTML/XML Injection and Parsing**
**Test Variables:**
```python
html_injection_tests = [
    "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
    "&lt;script&gt;alert('encoded');&lt;/script&gt;",
    "<img src=x onerror=alert('img')>",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><!DOCTYPE test><test>data</test>",
]
```
*Rationale: Known `<html>be<html>` detection suggests HTML parsing vulnerabilities.*

## **Priority 3: Extreme Length and Memory Exhaustion**
**Test Variables:**
```python
length_tests = [
    "be " * 10000,  # 30,000+ characters with E-prime violations
    "a" * 100000,   # Very long single word
    "999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999",
    "x\n" * 5000,   # Many line breaks
]
```
*Rationale: Known issue with long texts moving buttons outside user access.*

## **Priority 4: Quote and Apostrophe Edge Cases**
**Test Variables:**
```python
quote_tests = [
    "'be'",           # Single quotes (known issue)
    ""be"",           # Typesetter's quotes
    "‛be‛",           # Reversed quotes
    "be's",           # Typewriter apostrophe
    "be's",           # Typesetter apostrophe
]
```
*Rationale: Known inconsistencies with apostrophe handling and quote detection.*

## **Priority 5: Whitespace and Control Characters**
**Test Variables:**
```python
whitespace_tests = [
    "be\u0000is",     # Null character
    "be\u00A0is",     # Non-breaking space
    "be\u2000is",     # En quad
    "be\u200Bis",     # Zero-width space
    "be\tis",         # Tab character
]
```
*Rationale: Known issues with word separation logic and special characters.*

## **Priority 6: Number and Numeric String Edge Cases**
**Test Variables:**
```python
numeric_tests = [
    "1.00",
    "1E2",
    "-0",
    "NaN",
    "Infinity",
    "０１２３",         # Unicode numbers
    "١٢٣",            # Arabic numbers
]
```
*Rationale: Could reveal parsing issues with different number formats.*

## **Priority 7: Case Sensitivity and Text Transformation**
**Test Variables:**
```python
case_tests = [
    "BE",             # Uppercase E-prime
    "Be",             # Mixed case
    "İs",             # Turkish capital I with dot
    "ß",              # German sharp S (changes length when uppercased)
    "Ⱥ",              # Character that grows when lowercased
]
```
*Rationale: E-prime detection might have case sensitivity issues.*

## **Priority 8: Line Break and Formatting Injection**
**Test Variables:**
```python
format_tests = [
    "be\ris",         # Carriage return
    "be\r\nis",       # Windows line ending
    "be\u2028is",     # Line separator
    "be\u2029is",     # Paragraph separator
    "be\fis",         # Form feed
]
```
*Rationale: Known issues with line feed counting and special character handling.*

## **Priority 9: Reserved Words and System Commands**
**Test Variables:**
```python
reserved_tests = [
    "undefined",
    "null",
    "constructor",
    "eval(\"be\")",
    "System(\"ls\")",
    "../../../etc/passwd",
    "CON",            # Windows reserved filename
]
```
*Rationale: Could reveal backend processing vulnerabilities.*

## **Priority 10: Emoji and Modern Unicode**
**Test Variables:**
```python
emoji_tests = [
    "😍 be 👩🏽",
    "👨‍👩‍👦 is 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦",
    "🇺🇸🇷🇺🇸",       # Regional indicators
    "be️⃣",           # Keycap sequence
]
```
*Rationale: Modern applications often fail with complex emoji sequences, could reveal word counting issues.*

## Testing Strategy

These priorities focus on areas where the existing bug list suggests underlying parsing, encoding, or logic vulnerabilities that could be exploited with carefully crafted BLNS inputs to reveal new failure modes.

Each test category should be executed systematically, observing:
- Application behavior and error handling
- Word count accuracy 
- E-prime violation detection
- UI rendering and responsiveness
- Browser console errors
- Performance impacts

The goal is to find problems not yet documented in the existing bug list by leveraging known weaknesses with targeted malicious inputs.

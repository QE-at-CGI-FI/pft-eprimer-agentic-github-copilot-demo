# One-liner listing of bugs

- Css validator gives errors
- Special character as start of line forces an extra line change in grey display box
- Firefox text field does not clear with ctrl+R
- Safari allows for scrolling when the scroll bug is reintroduced unless the browser is restarted
- html validator identifies 3 errors
- You're / we're / They're contractions not recognised as violations of e-prime
- Two words separated by line feed are counted as one
- Human being is noun but recognised as violation
- Space is considered only separator for words and special characters are counted as words
- Long text moves button outside user's access as vertical scroll is disabled
- id naming is inconsistent, some are camel case, others not
- Long texts without spaces go outside the grey area reserved for displaying the texts
- Red/blue on grey has bad contrast
- Zoom or resize of browser renders page unusable due to missing scroll bars
- Contractions for word count (I'm) count as two words as per general searchable rules of how word counting works
- The possible violation's category takes possessives and leaves for human assessment and would probably be expected to be something to create programmatic rules on
- Possible violations does not handle typesetter's apostrophe, only typewriter's apostrophe in calculation
- Two part words (like people's last names) in possessive form are not recognised as possible violations
- Images missing alt text necessary for accessibility
- Accessibility warnings on contrast
- Mobile use not supported, styles very non-responsive
- UI instructions for user are unclear
- if word is in single quotes, it is not properly recognised as e-prime.
- text box location in UI is not where user would expect it to be as per the logic of how web pages are usually operating
- Site is missing favicon and security.txt - both common conventions for web applications
- Resizing the input text field can move it outside view so that it cannot be resized back
- Choosing which links are to overload this app and which open new browser window are inconsistent
- The terminology of discouraged / violations would be clearer if consistent terminology, e.g. discouraged words and possibly discouraged words
- Writing two possible violations together separated by full stop counts less words than violations. The counting logic does not match.
- <html>be<html> is detected
- Double-quoted be is detected while single-quoted be is not. 
- If single possessive is detected as blue, plural possessive should be too.

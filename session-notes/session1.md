# Session 1

## Charter: Explore Eprimer to discover how it can work

- *Target*: Eprimer GUI
- *Resources*: GUI in web browser
- *Information*: What is the story of possible value and use cases for the user of this application? Why does this application exist? 

## What We Did

- Looked at the GUI to learn this application helps user write English while avoiding the verb "to be"
- Tried inserting the text *to be* in the text box to learn it color codes *be* as red and counts it as *discouraged word* 
- Recognized we don't know what is *possible violations*
- Opened the linked Wikipedia page to learn about contractions, negative contractions and non-standard contractions, and functions of *to be*: identity, class membership, class inclusion, predication, ownership, auxiliary, existence and location. 
- Copied whole Wikipedia page content to the text field to learn the page includes *possible violations* but we cannot see what those are since the page does not scroll

## Details

- BUG: Scrolling does not work when text entered in text field is longer and requires scrolling
- TEST: Demo input *To be or not to be*, with 2 discouraged words and 6 words in total. 
- QUESTION: Can we fix the scrolling bug? Can we make the input shorter to see what is *possible violation*? 

## Other Charters

- Read Wikipedia page in detail and extract text worth entering as tests

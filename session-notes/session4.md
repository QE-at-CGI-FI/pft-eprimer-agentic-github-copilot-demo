# Session 1

## Charter: Explore Architecture and Code

- *Target*: Structure of the application
- *Resources*: Files and Network tab in Browser DevTools
- *Information*: What are reasonable expectations for this implementation? What is the scope of risks pertaining to this application? Are there issues one can identify by reading the code? 

## What We Did

- Opened the network tab in developer tools to confirm the application is frontend only, no network traffic other than loading the structure
- Read the javascript implementation to note the logic of red / blue detections

## Details

- BUG: The UI term *possible violations* is unclear description of manually verifiable detections
- BUG: *'re* is not implemented
- BUG: informal contractions are explicitly listed in code
- BUG: Scrolling bug is a mistake in the css with position being fixed rather than relative

## Other Charters

- Generate one liner listing of bugs
